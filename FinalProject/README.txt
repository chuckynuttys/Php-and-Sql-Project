I got most of the 'harder stuff' done so far on the project. 
Retrieving information and sending it from the user to the database.
Now I just need to make everything look pretty and do all the "front end" work.
I want to add some graphs and tables and a few images formatted for the user 
experince. I haven't added the "meals" stuff yet but it is just basically copy and
paste and change the values from the workouts/exercise stuff. Since this presentation
isn't until friday I kind of put this stuff on the backburner. Since Im 90% done
in my other classes all I have left to do is finish this project.
